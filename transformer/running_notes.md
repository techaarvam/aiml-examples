# Transformer Model Experiments - Running Notes

## Run 3 — Architecture Overhaul: Standard Pre-Norm Transformer (May 13–14, 2026)

### Architecture Changes from Run 2
- **Pre-norm** (LayerNorm before attention and FFN, not after)
- **Additive residual** (replaced non-standard concatenation residual)
- **Standard 4× FFN expansion**: d → 4d → d with GELU (was d → d)
- **head_dim = vecDims / num_heads** (was each head using full vecDims)

### Cloud Server (RTX 4090 48GB)
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| vecDims | 512 |
| num_heads | 8 |
| num_layers | 12 |
| window_size | 64 |
| batch_size | 700 (tuned to fill 45GB VRAM) |
| max_vocab_size | 30,000 |
| float_type | bfloat16 |
| Total params | 68,586,800 |
| Tokens | 104,327,545 |
| Batches/epoch | 149,040 |

### Local Machine (RTX 5070 12GB)
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| vecDims | 512 |
| num_layers | 8 |
| max_vocab_size | 50,000 |
| batch_size | 160 (tuned to fill 12GB VRAM) |
| Total params | ~76,000,000 |
| Batches/epoch | 652,047 |

### Parameter split: vocab vs transformer core
Vocab size dominates total parameter count. Larger vocab = more embedding + output params, fewer left for transformer layers.
| | Local (50k vocab) | Server (30k vocab) |
|---|---|---|
| Vocab-related params | 51.2M | 30.7M |
| Transformer core | 24.8M (8 layers) | 37.3M (12 layers) |
| Total | ~76M | 68.6M |
Server has more transformer core capacity despite lower total params.

### LR Experiments (Server, Epoch 1)
| LR | Vocab | Outcome |
|----|-------|---------|
| 0.0003 | 30k | Stable, steady — loss 6.29→6.08 over first 45K batches |
| 0.0012 | 30k | Unstable — running avg oscillating 8↔9 in first 1500 batches |
| 0.0008 | 30k | Started high (6.79), flattened rapidly, ~6.33 at 50% — worse than 0.0003 baseline |
| 0.0006 | 50k | 6.53→6.44→6.36 (10/20/30%) — see vocab experiment below |

### Loss Log — Server (lr=0.0003 baseline)
| Checkpoint | Batch | Loss |
|------------|-------|------|
| 10% | 14,904 | 6.2923 |
| 20% | 29,808 | 6.1602 |
| 30% | 44,712 | 6.0834 |

### Loss Log — Server (lr=0.0008 restart)
| Checkpoint | Batch | Loss |
|------------|-------|------|
| 10% | 14,904 | 6.7883 |
| 20% | 29,808 | 6.5144 |
| 30% | 44,712 | 6.4053 |
| 40% | 59,616 | 6.3446 |

| 10% | 16,301 | 6.5308 |
| 20% | 32,602 | 6.4404 |
| 30% | 48,903 | 6.3554 |

### Loss Log — Local (lr=0.0003)
| Checkpoint | Batch | Loss |
|------------|-------|------|
| 10% | 65,204 | 5.3889 |
| 20% | 130,408 | 5.0691 |
| 30% | 195,612 | 4.9001 |
| 40% | 260,816 | 4.7956 |
| 50% | 326,020 | 4.7245 |
| 60% | 391,224 | 4.6718 |
| 63% | 413,169 | 4.6571 |

### Vocab Size Experiment (Server, 50k vocab, lr=0.0006, batch=640)
Restarted server with 50k vocab to match local and isolate whether vocab was contributing to local's better convergence.

| | Baseline (random) | Loss at 10% | Gap closed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server (30k, lr=0.0003) | 10.30 | 6.29 | 59.0% |
| Server (50k, lr=0.0006) | 10.82 | 6.53 | 58.6% |
| Local  (50k, lr=0.0003) | 10.82 | 5.39 | 74.2% |

Server with 50k vocab and higher LR landed at virtually the same relative position as the original 30k run (58.6% vs 59%). Local is far ahead at 74%. **Vocab size is not the contributing factor — gradient steps are.** The local machine's 4× more updates per epoch is the dominant explanation, and it holds regardless of vocab size or LR changes on the server.

### Key Insight: Batch Size vs Gradient Steps
| | Local | Server |
|---|---|---|
| Batch size | 160 | 700 |
| Updates/epoch | 652,047 | 149,040 |
| Loss at ~50% epoch 1 | 4.72 | 6.33 |

Local is ahead in loss at the same wall-clock time (loss ~4.64 vs ~6.1 at 820 mins), but the gap is smaller than the gradient-step count alone suggests — server epochs complete in ~820 mins vs local's ~1235 mins, so the server partially compensates with faster epoch turnaround. The gradient step count (4.4× more on local) explains the loss gap; the faster server epoch time partially closes the wall-clock gap. Estimated wall-clock to loss=3.5: local ~12,350 mins (10 epochs), server ~16,400 mins (20 epochs) — local ~25% faster, not dramatically so. The 5070 at batch=160 appears better matched to this model size than the 4090 at batch=700.

Possible directions to explore (not yet experimented):
- Reduce server batch to ~256 to get more gradient steps while accepting lower VRAM utilisation
- MPS (Multi-Process Service) — allows multiple processes to share one GPU concurrently; unclear if this helps training convergence
- DDP (DistributedDataParallel) across multiple GPUs — each GPU handles a smaller batch, gradients averaged before update; could give both utilisation and gradient steps, but requires multi-GPU setup

### Critical Batch Size — Theoretical Shape
Convergence speed (loss drop per wall-clock time) vs batch size follows three regimes:

```
convergence
speed          ╭───────╮
               │       ╰──────────────
             ╭─╯
           ╭─╯
───────────╯
           1        Bs              N
                critical batch
```

- **Batch 1 → Bs:** noise-limited regime. Doubling batch ≈ halves steps needed — wall-clock convergence stays roughly constant. LR scaling keeps you here.
- **Around Bs:** peak efficiency — GPU well-utilised, gradient estimates accurate enough, update frequency still high.
- **Bs → N:** curvature-limited regime. Gradients are already accurate enough; larger batches buy less convergence per unit compute. Diminishing returns.

In our runs, batch=160 (local) converged faster than batch=640–700 (server) at the same wall-clock time, consistent with the server batch being in the diminishing returns regime.

### Learnings
Discovered that large batch sizes mean fewer gradient steps per epoch, which slows convergence — the fix is to scale LR proportionally with batch size (`lr = base_lr × batch/reference_batch`), something that wasn't obvious until comparing the server and local runs side by side. Tuning LR by watching live loss turned out to be unreliable and noisy; the standard approach for transformers is warmup + cosine decay. The original transformer paper (2017) includes warmup for this reason, and BERT and GPT-2 also use LR warmup. PyTorch's `CosineAnnealingLR` decays LR using `lr = eta_min + 0.5 × (lr_max - eta_min) × (1 + cos(π × t / T_max))` — warmup is a separate concern and not included. `OneCycleLR` combines both warmup and cosine decay in one scheduler.

### Observations from Training Curve
- Steady, consistent decrease in loss throughout training
- No signs of overfitting (would expect validation loss to increase while training loss decreases)
- Learning rate remained constant at 0.0003 throughout recorded epochs (plateau scheduler didn't trigger)
- Loss reduction appears to be slowing down as training progresses (asymptotic behavior)
- After 54 epochs, loss ~3.51, suggesting model has learned meaningful patterns but could benefit from more training

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Positional Encoding Approach
Unlike the original Transformer which uses sinusoidal positional encodings, this implementation:
- Keeps positional information in dimension 101 of the embedding space
- Uses a custom `embedPositions` function in `DataInput.py`
- This approach separates semantic information (dimensions 0-99) from positional information (dimension 100)

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Raw text → Tokenization (NLTK word_tokenize)
2. Tokens → GloVe vectors + indices (via `tokensToVecsAndIndices`)
3. Positional encoding applied via `embedPositions`
4. Sequence fed to Transformer model
5. Output processed based on `output_type`:
   - "indices": CrossEntropy loss with vocabulary prediction
   - "vecs": MSE loss with vector regression

### Model Saving/Loading
- Checkpoints saved after each epoch to `transformer_model.pth`
- Final model also saved explicitly
- Vocabulary saved to `vocab.json`
- Model loading restores state_dict and applies correct dtype/device

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Replace GloVe with nn.Embedding**: Modify DataInput.py to use trainable embedding layer instead of fixed GloVe vectors
2. **Fix Positional Encoding**: Implement standard sinusoidal positional encoding as in original Transformer paper
3. **Re-run Training**: Execute two experiments:
   - Case A: Trainable nn.Embedding + standard sinusoidal positional encoding
   - Case B: Trainable nn.Embedding + learned positional embeddings
4. **Compare Results**: Analyze loss curves and generation quality between approaches

## Future Experiments & Improvements
1. **Complete Training**: Run for full 100 epochs to see if loss continues to decrease
2. **Validation Split**: Add validation monitoring to detect overfitting
3. **Learning Rate Tuning**: Experiment with different LR schedules or initial values
4. **Architecture Variations**:
    - Experiment with different numbers of heads/layers
    - Try different embedding dimensions
5. **Output Type Comparison**: Compare "indices" vs "vecs" output types
6. **Prompt Engineering**: Test with different input contexts to evaluate generation quality
7. **Quantization**: Explore model quantization for deployment efficiency
8. **ONNX Export**: Utilize existing `onnxrun.py` and `pth2onnx.py` for deployment

## Files Modified/Created in This Session
- `transformer_model.pth`: Model checkpoint (updated during training)
- `vocab.json`: Vocabulary mapping
- Various `.pyc` files in `__pycache__`: Compiled Python bytecode

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates a functional Transformer implementation with custom positional encoding. The model shows ability to learn from text data and generate coherent continuations. The unconventional positional encoding approach (dimension 101) appears to be functioning correctly, though comparison with standard approaches would be valuable. Training shows steady convergence, suggesting the architecture is well-suited to the task.
